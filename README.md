# Weather App ⛅

This project is part of a FrontendMentor **Hackathon**

I've used *Open-Meteo* API for the weather and *Temporal* API for the dates

The project is **work in progress** and is built with **HTML**, **CSS** and plain **JavaScript**


## Current Features

- ✔️ Search location functionality
- ✔️ Displays current weather information - like temperature, apparent temperature, humidity, etc.
- ✔️ Displays location name and current date
- ✔️ Displays daily forecast, for up to 7 days, starting from the current day of the week

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open it with Live Server with **Firefox** browser (Temporal API is a new API that still works only for Firefox)
